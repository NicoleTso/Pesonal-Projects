<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

   <li>2 large zucchini</li>

<li>2 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>

<li>½ cup water, at room temperature</li>

<li>2 tablespoons flaxseed meal</li>

<li>½ cup shredded onion</li>

<li>½ cup shredded potato</li>

<li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>

<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>

<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>

<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>

<li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>

<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

<li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

<li>½ cup shredded carrot</li>

<li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

<li>½ cup olive oil</li>

</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Shred zucchini into a colander and sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons salt. Allow to drain over the sink for 20 minutes.</li>

<li>At the same time, mix water and flaxseed meal together until completely combined. Set aside and allow mixture to sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Squeeze out liquid from onions and potatoes by wringing them in a clean tea towel over the sink. Set aside.</li>
<li>Combine bread crumbs, mint, dill, parsley, lemon zest, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Add flaxseed meal mixture and mix to combine.</li>
<li>Rinse shredded zucchini very lightly and ring out any liquid in a tea towel. Add zucchini, shredded onion, potato, and carrot to the bread crumb mixture and combine. Add flour and baking powder and combine everything once more with your hands. Set aside to rest for at least 10 minutes on the counter, or up to 3 days, covered in the refrigerator.</li>

<li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a shallow frying pan over medium heat, making sure the oil doesn't burn.</li>
<li>Scoop zucchini mixture in 1/3-cup portions and roll into balls your hands. Working in batches, add balls to the hot oil and gently pat into a patty. Cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and continue to fry until crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining balls, adding 2 tablespoons more oil to the pan between each batch. Serve.</li>
