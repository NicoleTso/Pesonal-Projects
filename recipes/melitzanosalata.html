    <h1>Melitzanosalata Agioritiki(Athenian Eggplant Salad)</h1>
<img src="../images/melitzanosalata.jpg">

    <p>There are different ways to make eggplant salad, a very common summer salad in my country. This is a version called 'agioritiki' named from mount Athos (Agion Oros). It's refreshing with smoky flavor and can stay refrigerated up to three days. Serve it as a salad or on top of whole-wheat bread slices.</p>
